Here are 2 schematics and layouts for 1 wire interfaces. In the 1 wire
interface the tx and rx lines are to be tied together. The circuit only allows
half duplex communication similar to RS485 protocols but it works for the
older AP310 bootloader from Microchip as well as most interfaces using
rx and tx separately.

These circuits have been tested and the PCB designs work, I can supply
gerber files if there is interest, and for people who want to help on the
project I can supply working modules.

The RJ12 module has a micro USB connector; the USB_C module has a 
USB C connector and can provide higher power.

If you are interested in helping to add more devices to program
send me an email: react66@gmail.com  subject: bootloader-pic16

Thanks, Rob.
